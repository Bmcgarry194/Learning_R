A repository that teaches R to my fellow Urban Lab colleagues.

## Repository Structure

| `R`             | This is where all `.R` scripts will be held that are covered in class are stored. |
| `Resources`        | This folder will store resources to help expose folks to the material though a variety of slide decks, blog posts, and other relevant examples. |
